## üìÅ Data Sources

- `user_actions`: contains `user_id`, `order_id`, `action`, `time`
- `users`: contains `user_id`, `sex`, and other profile fields

---

## üß† Logic

1. Count the number of `cancel_order` and `create_order` actions per `user_id`
2. Calculate cancel rate using `FILTER (WHERE ...)` inside aggregation
3. Join results with the `users` table to get gender info
4. Use `COALESCE(sex, 'unknown')` to group users without gender
5. Calculate the average cancel rate per gender group

## üß© SQL Query

```sql
WITH cr AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    ROUND(
      COUNT(order_id) FILTER (WHERE action = 'cancel_order')::DECIMAL / 
      COUNT(order_id) FILTER (WHERE action = 'create_order'),
      2
    ) AS cancel_rate
  FROM user_actions
  GROUP BY user_id
), 
joined AS (
  SELECT user_id, cancel_rate, sex
  FROM cr 
  LEFT JOIN users u USING(user_id)
)

SELECT 
  COALESCE(sex, 'unknown') AS sex, 
  ROUND(AVG(cancel_rate), 3) AS avg_cancel_rate 
FROM joined 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
