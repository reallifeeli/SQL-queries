# 🛒 SQL Case: Top 10 Products by Delivered Orders (September 2022)

## 🎯 Goal

Identify the top 10 most purchased products in **delivered orders only**, during **September 2022**.

### Business constraints:
- A product is counted **only once per order**, even if it appears multiple times.
- Only orders with a **"deliver_order"** status are considered.
- Products are ranked by **how often they appeared in completed deliveries** during the selected period.

---

## 📁 Data Sources

- `orders`: contains `order_id` and `product_ids` (array)
- `courier_actions`: logs courier events (e.g. `deliver_order`, `cancel_order`) with timestamps
- `products`: product catalog (name, product_id, price, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Logic

1. Filter `courier_actions` to include only orders marked as `'deliver_order'` in September 2022.
2. Use `UNNEST(product_ids)` to expand arrays into rows.
3. Use `DISTINCT` to ensure a product is counted **once per order**.
4. Join with `products` to get product names.
5. Count how many times each product appeared in completed orders.

## 🧠 Final SQL Query

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT order_id, time
  FROM courier_actions
  WHERE action = 'deliver_order'
    AND time >= DATE '2022-09-01'
    AND time < DATE '2022-10-01'
), 
t2 AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT order_id, UNNEST(product_ids) AS product_id 
  FROM orders
),
joined AS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM t1 
  LEFT JOIN t2 USING(order_id)
)

SELECT 
  p.name, 
  COUNT(*) AS times_purchased
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN joined j USING(product_id)
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY times_purchased DESC
LIMIT 10;
